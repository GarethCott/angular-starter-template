## Key Services Details

### AmplifyService
Handles all AWS Amplify authentication operations with automatic token refresh:
- Sign up, sign in, and sign out
- Token management and refresh
- User session management

### ApolloGraphqlService
Manages GraphQL operations with Apollo Client:
- Query execution with error handling
- Mutation execution with optimistic updates
- Subscription handling for real-time updates
- Advanced caching configuration

### ThemeService
Manages application themes with daisyUI integration:
- Theme switching with persistent storage
- Observable theme state for components to subscribe
- Multiple theme options from daisyUI
- Automatic application of themes across components

### AuthInterceptor
Automatically adds authentication tokens to HTTP requests:
- Skips GraphQL requests (handled by Apollo)
- Adds authorization headers to REST API calls
- Handles token retrieval and management

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is separated from GraphQL operations
2. **Lazy Loading**: Routes are lazy-loaded for better initial load time
3. **Authentication Strategy**: Token refresh is handled automatically
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across the application
5. **Feature Modules**: Code is organized by feature for better maintainability
6. **Environment Configuration**: Clear separation between development and production
7. **Standalone Components**: Using Angular's modern component architecture for better performance and maintainability
8. **Utility-First CSS**: Using Tailwind CSS for consistent, maintainable styling without custom CSS
9. **Component Library**: Using daisyUI for high-quality, themeable UI components
10. **Reactive Programming**: Using RxJS for reactive state management
11. **UI Theming**: Implementing theme switching with persistent user preferences

## Implemented Architecture Improvements

### Standalone Components
We've migrated from traditional NgModule-based components to Angular's standalone component architecture:

- All components now use `standalone: true` in their decorator
- Components explicitly import their dependencies in the `imports` array
- Routing directly references standalone components instead of loading modules
- Eliminated unnecessary NgModule declarations for better tree-shaking

Benefits of this approach include:
- Simplified architecture with less boilerplate
- Better bundle optimization through more explicit dependencies
- Improved developer experience with clearer dependency management
- Easier testing with self-contained components

Example of a standalone component:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
  template: `...`,
  styles: [`...`]
})
export class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Layout Component System

We've developed a comprehensive layout component system to provide consistent structure across the application:

- **ContainerComponent**: A configurable container with consistent sizing and padding
  - Provides consistent layout containers with configurable size, padding, and styling
  - Used in main layout for consistent page structure

- **PageLayoutComponent**: A page wrapper with consistent header styling
  - Provides standardized page structure with configurable title and subtitle
  - Best used for feature pages and content areas

- **ContentCardComponent**: A card container for content blocks
  - Provides consistent styling for content sections
  - Includes header, content area, and optional action footer

- **GridLayoutComponent**: A responsive grid layout system
  - Configurable columns (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) and gap spacing
  - Responsive by default with different column counts on different screen sizes

These layout components are selectively used based on the component purpose:
- Content-heavy, authenticated pages (Profile, Home, Dashboard) use the layout component system
- Authentication components (Login, Register) use direct daisyUI components for simplicity
- All components use daisyUI classes for styling and UI components

Benefits of this approach:
- Consistent structure and spacing across the application
- Simplified component templates with reusable layout patterns
- Clear separation between layout structure and UI components
- Appropriate use of components based on their purpose and complexity

Example usage of layout components:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, PageLayoutComponent, ContentCardComponent, GridLayoutComponent],
  template: `
    <app-page-layout title="Welcome" subtitle="Dashboard overview">
      <app-grid-layout [columns]="3" gap="md">
        <app-content-card title="Statistics">
          Content goes here
        </app-content-card>
        <!-- More cards -->
      </app-grid-layout>
    </app-page-layout>
  `
})
```

### Tailwind CSS and daisyUI Integration
We've integrated Tailwind CSS with daisyUI for a comprehensive UI approach:

- All components use Tailwind and daisyUI utility classes instead of custom CSS
- Configuration is set up in tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js
- Global styles include Tailwind directives and daisyUI integration
- Components are styled consistently using Tailwind's utility classes and daisyUI components
- Theme switching functionality with persistent preferences is implemented

Benefits of this approach include:
- Faster UI development with pre-built utility classes and components
- Consistent design language across components
- Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS optimization
- Better maintainability without custom CSS classes
- Responsive design out of the box
- Multiple theme options with easy switching

Example of daisyUI component usage:
```html
<div class="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
    <p>Card content goes here.</p>
    <div class="card-actions justify-end">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Action</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Enhanced Home Page

We've created a visually stunning home page that showcases the template's features:

- **Hero Section**: A modern, responsive hero section with call-to-action buttons
- **Stats Dashboard**: Interactive stats cards with hover animations
- **Feature Cards**: Clean, animated cards highlighting key features with SVG icons
- **Two-Column Layout**: Responsive content layout that adapts to screen size
- **Call-to-Action Section**: Clear, prominent section encouraging user action

The home page demonstrates several advanced techniques:

- **Component Separation**: HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript are cleanly separated
- **Data-Driven Design**: Content is derived from component properties for easy updates
- **Advanced SCSS**: Uses animations, transitions, and pseudo-elements for visual appeal
- **Accessibility**: Maintains good contrast ratios and semantic markup
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Custom styling for light and dark themes

Example of the enhanced component structure:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    CommonModule, 
    RouterModule,
    PageLayoutComponent, 
    ContentCardComponent, 
    GridLayoutComponent
  ],
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss']
})
export class HomeComponent {
  features = [
    {
      title: 'Angular Standalone',
      description: 'Modern architecture with self-contained components',
      icon: 'module',
      color: 'primary'
    },
    // more features...
  ];
  
  // additional component logic...
}
```
