## Implementation Guide for Pending Items

### Dashboard Component
Create a basic dashboard standalone component:
```typescript
// src/app/features/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  template: `
    <div class="dashboard-container">
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>Welcome to your dashboard.</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .dashboard-container {
      padding: 20px;
    }
  `]
})
export class DashboardComponent { }
```

### Admin Component
Create an admin standalone component with role protection:
```typescript
// src/app/features/admin/admin.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-admin',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  template: `
    <div class="admin-container">
      <h2>Admin Panel</h2>
      <p>Admin functionality goes here.</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styles: [`
    .admin-container {
      padding: 20px;
    }
  `]
})
export class AdminComponent { }
```

## Key Services Details

### AmplifyService
Handles all AWS Amplify authentication operations with automatic token refresh:
- Sign up, sign in, and sign out
- Token management and refresh
- User session management

### ApolloGraphqlService
Manages GraphQL operations with Apollo Client:
- Query execution with error handling
- Mutation execution with optimistic updates
- Subscription handling for real-time updates
- Advanced caching configuration

### ThemeService
Manages application themes with daisyUI integration:
- Theme switching with persistent storage
- Observable theme state for components to subscribe
- Multiple theme options from daisyUI
- Automatic application of themes across components

### AuthInterceptor
Automatically adds authentication tokens to HTTP requests:
- Skips GraphQL requests (handled by Apollo)
- Adds authorization headers to REST API calls
- Handles token retrieval and management

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is separated from GraphQL operations
2. **Lazy Loading**: Routes are lazy-loaded for better initial load time
3. **Authentication Strategy**: Token refresh is handled automatically
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across the application
5. **Feature Modules**: Code is organized by feature for better maintainability
6. **Environment Configuration**: Clear separation between development and production
7. **Standalone Components**: Using Angular's modern component architecture for better performance and maintainability
8. **Utility-First CSS**: Using Tailwind CSS for consistent, maintainable styling without custom CSS
9. **Component Library**: Using daisyUI for high-quality, themeable UI components
10. **Reactive Programming**: Using RxJS for reactive state management
11. **UI Theming**: Implementing theme switching with persistent user preferences

## Implemented Architecture Improvements

### Standalone Components
We've migrated from traditional NgModule-based components to Angular's standalone component architecture:

- All components now use `standalone: true` in their decorator
- Components explicitly import their dependencies in the `imports` array
- Routing directly references standalone components instead of loading modules
- Eliminated unnecessary NgModule declarations for better tree-shaking

Benefits of this approach include:
- Simplified architecture with less boilerplate
- Better bundle optimization through more explicit dependencies
- Improved developer experience with clearer dependency management
- Easier testing with self-contained components

Example of a standalone component:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
  template: `...`,
  styles: [`...`]
})
export class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {
  // Component logic
}
```

### Tailwind CSS and daisyUI Integration
We've integrated Tailwind CSS with daisyUI for a comprehensive UI approach:

- All components use Tailwind and daisyUI utility classes instead of custom CSS
- Configuration is set up in tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js
- Global styles include Tailwind directives and daisyUI integration
- Components are styled consistently using Tailwind's utility classes and daisyUI components
- Theme switching functionality with persistent preferences is implemented

Benefits of this approach include:
- Faster UI development with pre-built utility classes and components
- Consistent design language across components
- Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS optimization
- Better maintainability without custom CSS classes
- Responsive design out of the box
- Multiple theme options with easy switching

Example of daisyUI component usage:
```html
<div class="card bg-base-100 shadow-xl">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
    <p>Card content goes here.</p>
    <div class="card-actions justify-end">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Action</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
